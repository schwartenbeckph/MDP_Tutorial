# MDP Tutorial

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a general framework for modelling choice behaviour of animals and artificial agents in the context of sequential decision-making. 

MDP_Tutorial.ipynb is meant to guide through the structure and dynamics of a MDP, computing state and action values within a MDP and dealing with partial observability.
